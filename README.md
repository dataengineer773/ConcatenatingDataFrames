We want to concatenate two DataFrames, we Use concat with axis=0 to concatenate along the row axis, I can use axis=1 to concatenate along the column axis, Concatenating is not a word you hear much outside of computer science and programming, so if you
have not heard it before, do not worry. The informal definition of concatenate is to glue two objects together. In the solution we glued together two small DataFrames using the axis parameter to indicate
whether we wanted to stack the two DataFrames on top of each other or place them side by side.
